# Security Anomaly Detection System

This project is an intelligent anomaly detection system that analyzes user activities in real-time to identify suspicious behaviors. It uses a machine learning model (Gradient Boosting) to detect anomalies in activity logs and stores results in a Neo4j graph database.

## Key Points
- Flask REST API for log processing
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Neo4j data storage for in-depth analysis
- Automatic data preprocessing
